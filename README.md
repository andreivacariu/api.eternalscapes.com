# api.eternalscapes.com
This is the very old API to Eternals Capes, a free cape service for Minecraft. It works by replacing optifine nameservers with the server ip the API is running on. __Should__ still work together with the website. \n
The code is about 2 years old, but i had to nuke the old repostory due to having passwords uploaded by accident on github ðŸ¤¦.

# Instalation
```bash
npm i
```
Fill in the MySQL password and username in `/config/db.config.js` You need to create the tables yourself. Good luck with that.
